#### v0.9.1

* Fixes bugs caused by simple typos in `v0.9.0` ([#39](https://github.com/logankoester/grunt-phonegap/pull/39), [#40](https://github.com/logankoester/grunt-phonegap/pull/40)) - thanks [@mkai](https://github.com/mkai)!
* Reverts to using `phonegap local plugin add` (as opposed to `phonegap plugin add`) after discovering that the shortcut is not available in some versions of [phonegap-cli](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-cli)
* Release tags created by `grunt-bump` should now be signed.
